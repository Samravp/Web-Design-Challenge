# Web Visualisation Dashboard

## Latitude Analysis Dashboard

For this project, I created a visualisation dashboard website.

In building this dashboard, I've create individual pages for each plot and a means by which I can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualisations and their corresponding explanations. 

I also have a landing page, a page where I can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where I can view the data used to build them.

### Website Features

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A Landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualisations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image will take the user to that visualisation.
  
* Four visualisation pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualisation itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
  
* A comparisons page that:
  * Contains all of the visualisations on the same page so user can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualisations.
  
* A data page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualisations.

The website at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Is responsive and has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualisation page.
* Provides two text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.

Finally, the website was deployed to GitHub pages.
